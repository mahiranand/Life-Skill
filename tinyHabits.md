- One interesting idea from BJ Fogg's talk is that celebrating small successes is really important. He suggests that even the smallest steps toward change should be acknowledged and celebrated. By doing this, it helps us feel good and motivates us to keep going with our habits. Fogg believes that celebrating these little wins is a powerful way to make lasting changes in our lives.

## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

- B = MAP stands for Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. It's a simple framework to understand the elements necessary for behavior change.
- **breakdown of each component**:
    - **Motivation (M):** This is your desire or reason to do something. Find reasons that make you want to do the habit, like feeling good or reaching a goal.
    - **Ability (A)**: It's how easy or hard the habit is. Make the habit super easy to do, so it doesn't feel like a big effort.
    - **Prompt (P):** This is a reminder or cue to do the habit. Set up reminders or triggers that prompt you to do the habit, like a phone alarm or linking it to something you already do daily.

## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

- Celebrating after doing something you wanted to do helps your brain feel happy and proud. It's like giving yourself a high-five! When you feel good about doing a habit, your brain remembers that feeling and wants to do it again. So, celebrating your wins makes it more likely that you'll keep doing that habit. It's like cheering yourself on to keep going!

- One of the most fascinating concepts from James Clear's talk is the idea of getting better by just 1% each day. He explained how making small improvements, even just a little bit every day, can lead to big changes over time. It's like taking small steps regularly that add up to significant progress in the long run. This idea encourages people to focus on consistent and manageable improvements rather than trying to make huge changes all at once.

## What is the book's perspective about Identity?
 
- In "Atomic Habits," James Clear talks about how our habits connect to who we see ourselves as. He says it's better to focus on habits that match the kind of person we want to be instead of only aiming for certain results. By doing habits that fit with the person we want to become—like seeing ourselves as healthy—we're more likely to keep doing these habits over time. Basically, the book suggests that if we shape our identity around good behaviors, it helps us make lasting changes in our habits.

## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

1. **Start Tiny:** Begin with a small action, like doing 1 minute of the habit.

## Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

- I'd like to read more regularly. To make it more attractive and easier: 
    1. **Make the Cue Obvious:** I'll place a book on my bedside table to see it before sleeping, reminding me to read.
    1. **Make the Habit Attractive:** I'll create a cozy reading corner with comfy pillows and soft lighting to make reading more inviting.
    1. **Make it Easy:** I'll start with just reading one page each night before bed to make it an easy, achievable habit.

## Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

- I'd like to reduce my time spent scrolling through social media mindlessly.
    1. **Hide the Cue:** Keep the phone away or turn off notifications.
    1. **Make It Less Appealing:** Unfollow unhelpful accounts and remove easy access to social apps.
    1. **Add Difficulty:** Set up barriers like extra passwords or time delays.
    1. **Make It Unsatisfying:** Remind yourself of wasted time to motivate better use of time.
