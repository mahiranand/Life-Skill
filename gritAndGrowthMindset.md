## What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

1. **Focus on What You Can Do**: Instead of worrying about things you can't control, think about what you can influence. I always remind myself that my effort and choices matter, and they're keys to making things happen.
2. **Set Goals That Make Sense:** Break down your goals into smaller steps. I find it easier to stay motivated when I set achievable targets. Each small victory feels like a step closer to my bigger dreams.
3. **Be Your Own Cheerleader:** Tell yourself positive things. I often encourage myself with words like, "You've got this!" Having a positive attitude about what I'm capable of keeps me going, especially when things get tough.
4. **Learn from Challenges**: When things don't go as planned, I try to see them as opportunities to learn. It's like turning setbacks into lessons that help me grow. Embracing challenges has helped me stay strong and motivated along the way.

## What are your ideas to take action and build Growth Mindset?

1. **Trying New Things:** I make it a point to try new stuff, even if it feels hard at first. It's funny, but the more I try, the more I realize I can actually get better at things I never thought I could do.
1. **Learning from Mistakes:** When I mess up, instead of feeling down, I try to see what went wrong. It's like turning a problem into a lesson. That way, I can do better next time.
1. **Enjoying the Learning Journey:** I used to think being perfect was the goal, but now I see that it's about getting better bit by bit. I celebrate my progress, even if it's small, because every step counts towards being better than yesterday.
