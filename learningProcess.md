## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- In her TED talk "Learning How to Learn," Barbara Oakley talks about cool brain tricks to help you learn better. She explains how our brains work when we're learning and gives tips on studying smarter, like using different thinking modes and managing procrastination. Oakley shows how understanding our brains can make learning easier and more effective.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

- **Active Mode:** When you're intensely focused on something specific, like studying for a test or solving a math problem, you're in the active mode. It's like a bright spotlight, helping you concentrate deeply on one thing at a time.

- **Diffuse Mode:** When your mind is more relaxed, not focused on any one thing, and just wandering or daydreaming, that's the diffuse mode. It's like a background process where your brain makes connections more freely and sees the big picture.

>To learn better, it's good to switch between these modes. Focus hard when you need to learn something (active mode), but take breaks or do something different to let your mind make connections on its own (diffuse mode). This switching helps with understanding and creativity.
