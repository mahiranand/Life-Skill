## What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

1. **Give full attention:** Focus on the speaker without distractions, maintain eye contact, and show genuine interest.
2. **Use non-verbal cues**: Employ nods, gestures, and facial expressions to indicate understanding and engagement.
3. **Paraphrase and summarize:** Repeat or rephrase what the speaker said to confirm understanding and show active involvement.
4. **Ask clarifying questions:** Seek clarity by asking open-ended questions to encourage elaboration and ensure comprehension.
5. **Reflect on emotions:** Acknowledge and understand the speaker's feelings without judgment, validating their emotions.
6. **Avoid interruptions:** Refrain from interrupting; allow the speaker to finish before sharing your thoughts or opinions.

## According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

- Repeat what the person said or say it in your own words to show you understand.
- Reflect the emotions they're expressing to show you understand how they feel.
- Sum up the main points to show you were listening carefully.
- Use short phrases like "I see" or nodding to encourage them to keep talking.
- Respond with care and understanding to show you respect their feelings.
- Use your body language, like nodding, to show you're interested and paying attention.

## What are the obstacles in your listening process?

- **Distractions:** Things like noise or personal thoughts can make it hard to focus on what someone is saying.
- **Biases and Prejudgments:** Having ideas or opinions beforehand about the speaker or the topic can affect how we understand their message.
- **Losing Focus:** When our mind wanders or we're not paying attention, we might miss important details.
- **Emotional Interference:** Strong emotions or stress can make it difficult to listen without letting our feelings get in the way.
- **Preparing Responses:** Thinking about what to say next instead of fully understanding what's being said can be an obstacle to effective listening.
